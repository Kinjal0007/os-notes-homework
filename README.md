# Operating Systems: Learning Journey

This repository documents my learning journey through Operating Systems concepts, following the [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) (OSTEP) book and its [homework assignments](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-homework).

## Code Examples

### Virtualization Examples

- **CPU Virtualization** (`virtualization/Introduction/cpu.cpp`): Demonstrates basic CPU scheduling
- **Memory Virtualization** (`virtualization/Introduction/mem.cpp`): Shows memory management
- **Thread Operations** (`virtualization/Introduction/thread.cpp`): Basic thread handling
- **I/O Operations** (`virtualization/Introduction/io.cpp`): Input/Output handling

### Process API Examples

- **Basic Process Creation** (`virtualization/Process-Api/p1.cpp`): Simple fork() example
- **Process Control** (`virtualization/Process-Api/p2.cpp`): Process management
- **Process Execution** (`virtualization/Process-Api/p3.cpp`): exec() family usage
- **Complex Interactions** (`virtualization/Process-Api/p4.cpp`): Advanced process control

## Building and Running

Each code example can be compiled and run independently:

```bash
# For Introduction examples
gcc -o cpu virtualization/Introduction/cpu.cpp
gcc -o mem virtualization/Introduction/mem.cpp
gcc -o thread virtualization/Introduction/thread.cpp
gcc -o io virtualization/Introduction/io.cpp

# For Process API examples
gcc -o p1 virtualization/Process-Api/p1.cpp
gcc -o p2 virtualization/Process-Api/p2.cpp
gcc -o p3 virtualization/Process-Api/p3.cpp
gcc -o p4 virtualization/Process-Api/p4.cpp
```
